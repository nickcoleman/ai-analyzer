WEEKLY AI & MAG7 INTELLIGENCE TASK

## TASK OBJECTIVE
Analyze Magnificent Seven and AI narrative status. Search for individual stock prices and market context to assess: (1) Mag7 individual performance vs. market, (2) core AI infrastructure (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG) vs. speculative AI (TSLA, META, AAPL), (3) which AI narrative dominates (infrastructure resilient, hype cracking, or all unwinding), (4) concentration risk. Return markdown report focused on market leadership and AI theme health.

**Execution:** Any time after market close Friday and Monday market open.

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION

Use `search_web` to gather Mag7 and AI context:

1. **Mag7 Stock Prices:** `"NVIDIA MSFT Apple Amazon Tesla Meta Google stock price this week"`
2. **AI Narrative:** `"artificial intelligence stocks AI theme market performance 2025"`
3. **Semiconductor/AI Infrastructure:** `"semiconductor stocks nvidia chipmakers AI capex trend"`
4. **EV/Autonomy/Tech Hype:** `"Tesla FSD autopilot autonomous driving Meta AI strategy"`
5. **Tech Concentration:** `"Magnificent Seven market concentration S&P 500 percentage"`

### PHASE 2: ANALYSIS

**MAG7 INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE**
- Extract: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, META, GOOG current prices
- Week direction: Up/stable/down for each
- Categorize: Core AI infrastructure vs. Speculative AI
- Pattern: All moving together or diverging? Which strongest/weakest?

**CORE AI VS. SPECULATIVE SPLIT**
- Core (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG): Infrastructure, capex, cloud, semiconductors
- Speculative (TSLA, META, AAPL): Hype-driven (FSD, metaverse, AI iPhone rumors)
- Compare performance: Are they diverging?

**AI NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT**
- Narrative A: Infrastructure Resilient (MSFT/AMZN holding, capex cycle intact)
- Narrative B: Hype Deflating (TSLA/META cracking, MSFT/GOOG stable = market differentiating)
- Narrative C: Broader Unwinding (All Mag7 cracking including NVDA = AI thesis questioned)
- Which narrative has highest probability?

**CONCENTRATION RISK**
- Mag7 % of S&P 500 gains
- If >35%: Extreme concentration, high reversal risk
- If 25-35%: Elevated, watch for rotation
- If <25%: Healthy breadth

## CORE AI INFRASTRUCTURE (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG)

**Weekly Performance:** [Up / Stable / Down]

**Momentum:** [Strong / Stable / Weakening]

**Status Assessment:** 
- NVDA: [Price level, near any support/resistance, capex thesis status]
- MSFT: [Azure AI momentum, Copilot adoption, enterprise traction]
- AMZN: [AWS AI services growth, cloud AI revenue acceleration]
- GOOG: [Gemini adoption, Search AI integration, competitive position]

**Core AI Infrastructure Verdict:** [RESILIENT / PRESSURED / CRACKING]

**Implication:** [1-2 sentences on what core AI performance tells us about AI capex cycle health]

---

## SPECULATIVE AI (TSLA, META, AAPL)

**Weekly Performance:** [Up / Stable / Down]

**Momentum:** [Strong / Stable / Weakening]

**Status Assessment:**
- TSLA: [FSD progress/skepticism, autonomous driving reality vs. hype, valuation stretched]
- META: [Metaverse capex reality check, Llama AI open-source adoption, profitability focus]
- AAPL: [AI iPhone speculation, actual AI integration roadmap, realistic or overblown]

**Speculative AI Verdict:** [EUPHORIC / SUSTAINABLE / CRACKING]

**Implication:** [1-2 sentences on what speculative AI performance tells us about hype vs. reality]

---

## AI NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT: WHICH STORY IS WINNING?

### Narrative A: "Core AI Infrastructure Resilient"

**Evidence:** [MSFT/AMZN/GOOG holding or up while market tests]

**Probability:** [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]

**Implication:** 
- Capex cycle intact, AI investment thesis valid
- Quality infrastructure companies sustain premium valuations
- Market differentiating between substance and hype

---

### Narrative B: "Rotation from Hype to Substance"

**Evidence:** [TSLA/META cracking while MSFT/AMZN/GOOG stable/up]

**Probability:** [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]

**Implication:**
- Market not abandoning AI, just repricng hype
- Investors rotating FROM speculative AI TOWARD core AI infrastructure
- Healthy market discrimination = buy quality, avoid overhyped

---

### Narrative C: "Broader AI Theme Unwinding"

**Evidence:** [All Mag7 cracking together, including NVDA below key support]

**Probability:** [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]

**Implication:**
- AI capex cycle expectations being cut across the board
- Valuations too high, disappointment setting in
- AI theme losing momentum broadly, not just in hype stocks

---

## WINNING NARRATIVE

[1-2 sentences identifying which narrative has highest probability based on data]

**Most Likely Outcome:** [Which story is the market telling this week?]

**Key Watch:** [What would confirm or invalidate this narrative?]

---

## MAG7 CONCENTRATION RISK

**Current Status:** Mag7 = [X]% of S&P 500 gains

| Risk Level | Threshold | Status | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Extreme** | >40% | [✓ or ✗] | [If exceeded: Begin reducing concentration] |
| **Elevated** | 35-40% | [✓ or ✗] | [Current status: Monitor closely] |
| **Moderate** | 25-35% | [✓ or ✗] | [Healthy participation] |
| **Low** | <25% | [✓ or ✗] | [Broad market health] |

**Concentration Verdict:** [HEALTHY / ELEVATED / EXTREME]

**Reversal Risk:** [LOW / MODERATE / HIGH]
- If Mag7 underperforms by >2% next week, broad market gains erased

---

## MARKET LEADERSHIP ASSESSMENT

### What This Means for Market Health

[2-3 sentences synthesizing:]
- Are Mag7 stocks leading market higher (bullish) or propping up weak market (bearish)?
- Is AI theme driving market (healthy) or market cap concentration (risky)?
- Is rotation into core AI vs. away from hype creating opportunity or danger?

### Positioning Implications

**Mag7 Exposure:** [INCREASE / HOLD / REDUCE]
- If core AI resilient: Hold or increase quality (MSFT, AMZN)
- If all cracking: Reduce exposure, wait for capitulation

**Speculative AI:** [AVOID / SELECTIVE / OVERWEIGHT]
- TSLA/META/AAPL: [Overvalued hype / Fair value / Opportunity]

**Breadth Strategy:** [DIVERSIFY / CONCENTRATE / BALANCE]
- If Mag7 concentration extreme: Rotate into non-Mag7 quality
- If concentration healthy: Can maintain current allocation

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **All data from searches.** No fabricated stock prices.
2. **Focus on AI narrative.** Answer: "Is AI theme intact or breaking?"
3. **Core vs. Speculative split critical.** This differentiation is the story.
4. **Concentration risk prominent.** Mag7 dependency is largest systemic risk.
5. **Probability scoring.** Assign likelihood to each narrative.
6. **No macro deep-dive.** That's Task 1. Just reference macro context for AI capex assumptions.

---
