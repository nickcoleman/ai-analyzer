### Technical Analysis
- **Golden Cross:** Likely Active (+2 to +5 pts)
- **Death Cross:** Not Triggered (0 pts)
- **RSI:** 55–65 range (neutral-bullish)
- **Volume:** Moderate ($4.3M/day)
- **Trend:** Ascending with support at ~$24

**Technical Conviction Adjustment:** +2 to +3 pts

**Final Conviction:** 68 + 2.5 = **70.5 → 71** (HIGH tier)

### Valuation
- P/E: 23.6x (premium justified by growth)
- EV/EBITDA: 6.0x (vs sector 7–9x)
- PEG: 1.1x (fair for 21% growth)
- Dividend: 0% (retaining for growth/debt reduction)

### Exit Strategy
- **Hard Stop:** $22.50 (13% downside)
- **Profit Target 1:** $29–$30 (12–15% upside) - Exit 50%
- **Profit Target 2:** $33–$35 (Full bull case) - Exit remaining
- **Conviction Erosion Triggers:** Argentina capital controls, earnings miss >10%, negative traffic growth 2 quarters

### Risk Assessment

**High Risks:**
1. Argentina macro volatility (inflation, currency depreciation, capital controls)
2. Q4 headwinds (easier comparisons, management guidance moderation)
3. Valuation multiple compression if growth disappoints

**Medium Risks:**
1. Emerging market macro uncertainty
2. Competition from alternative travel modes
3. Post-pandemic normalization (traffic growth may moderate)

**Low Risks:**
1. Operational execution (track record strong)
2. Geographic diversification mitigates single-country risk
